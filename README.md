# PomoDo
A non-intrusive application for managing your Pomodoros.

## What is PomoDo?
PomoDo is a non-intrusive utility to track and manage your practice of the Pomodoro technique. Designed for Windows, the application will minimise into the tray. When in tray mode, the core actions will be available. However, to interact with the application on a more personal level, such as adding tasks or marking them as complete, the application can be opened in window mode. 

### NuGet Packages
NUnit and NUnit3TestAdapter are used in this solution for Unit testing. The versions can be found in the `packages.config` file. 

To have Visual Studio NuGet handle retreiving the packages for you, see [Edward Wilde's StackOverflow answer.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7619988/5012644).
