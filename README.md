# PomoDo
A non-intrusive application for managing your Pomodoros.

## What is PomoDo?
PomoDo is a non-intrusive utility to track and manage your practise of the Pomodoro technique. Designed for Windows, the application will minimise into the tray. When in tray mode, the core actions will be available. However, to interact with the application on a more personal level, such as adding tasks or marking them as complete, the application can be opened in window mode.
